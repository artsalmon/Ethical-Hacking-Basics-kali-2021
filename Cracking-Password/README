There are several scripts in this folder that will be used in the course. They are mostly PowerShell (ps1) or text documents (txt)
•	The “Adduser” script will add local users with passwords to the local machine.
  o The Adduser-Intro will add 5 users with simple password (4 characters, all of them numbers)
  o	The Adduser-easy will add 10 users with simple password (6 characters, all of them numbers)
  o	The Adduser-easy2 will add 10 users with simple password (8 characters, all of them lower case letters)
  o	The Adduser-normal will add 10 users with normal password (8 characters, the first seven are lower case letters, and the last character is a number)
  o	The Adduser-hard will add 10 users with normal password (8 characters, using upper case, lower case, and numbers)
•	The “Remove” script will remove the corresponding users.
•	The wordlists will be used to crack the passwords of the added users. Some of the word lists are not complete word lists as I only generated around 10000 possible combinations. But this is more than fine for the examples used in the course. 
  o	Wordlist-intro has 9999 combinations of numbers
  o	Wordlist-easy has 999999 combinations of numbers
  o	Wordlist-easy2 has around 415 combinations
  o	Wordlist-normal has around 10000 combinations
  o	Wordlist-hard has around 10000 combinations
